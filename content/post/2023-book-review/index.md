This year, I made a cognizant push to read more often and consistently.
I think I was successful, definitely improving over the previous year, and I finished [N books this year](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11633-2023-reading-challenge). <!-- TODO (JHC): Fill in final number of books. -->
Below is a review of my favorite books of the year.

> All links of books and authors go to [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/).
> Also I left of subtitles because all books have subtitles and I don't like them.
